  <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

  <p>This statement was last updated on October 2025.</p>

  <p>We at <strong>Gangwayy Records</strong> are working to make our site <strong>https://www.gangwayyrecords.store</strong> accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

  <h2>What Web Accessibility Is</h2>
  <p>An accessible site allows visitors with disabilities to browse the site with the same or a similar level of ease and enjoyment as other visitors. This can be achieved with the capabilities of the system on which the site is operating, and through assistive technologies.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility Adjustments on This Site</h2>
  <p>We have adapted this site in accordance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, and have made the site accessible to the level of AA. This site's contents have been adapted to work with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard use. As part of this effort, we have also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the language of the site</li>
    <li>Defined clear heading structures on all of the site’s pages</li>
    <li>Added alternative text to images</li>
    <li>Implemented color combinations that meet the required color contrast</li>
    <li>Reduced the use of motion on the site</li>
    <li>Ensured all videos, audio, and files on the site are accessible</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Declaration of Partial Compliance With the Standard</h2>
  <p>The accessibility of certain pages on the site depends on content that belong to third parties. We therefore declare partial compliance with the standard for these pages.</p>

  <h2>Requests, Issues and Suggestions</h2>
  <p>If you find an accessibility issue on the site, or if you require further assistance, you are welcome to contact us through our accessibility coordinator:</p>
